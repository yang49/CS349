            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Implement a "breakout" game in C or C++ and Xlib.</p>
                                
                <p style="margin: 10pt 10pt 10pt 10pt">Breakout is a simple 2D video game, originally published by Atari in 1976. "In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play." (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>.)</p>

                <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn how the event loop that underlies all GUI programs works.</li>
                        <li>Learn how to handle real-time drawing and animation of simple graphics.</li>
                        <li>Learn about the painter's algorithm and double buffering.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Breakout Description</h2>
                <p>There are many versions of Breakout playable on the web (<a href="http://www.roundgames.com/onlinegame/Breakout">here</a> or <a href="http://www.gamesloon.com/free-arcade-3/breakout-games-193/break-blocks-4066.html">here</a>). You need to implement a simple version that includes the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Your game should have at least 5 rows of colored blocks along the top of the screen, and a single paddle along the bottom. The player can move the paddle left and right across the screen.</li>
                    <li>When the game starts, a ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the side and top walls in a realistic 
                    fashion.</li>
                    <li>If the ball hits a block, the block disappears and the ball bounces.</li>
                    <li>If the ball strikes the paddle, it bounces. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.</li>
                    <li>You should keep track of the players score, awarding points for every bounce of the ball. Display the current score on-screen during the game.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>You also need to add one additional feature of your choice. For full marks, this feature should be a significant enhancement to gameplay (e.g. multiple levels that can be cleared, or "power-ups" that significantly enhance gameplay). Changing colors/fonts, or making other superficial additions is not a sufficient addition, and will only result in part marks for this section (see below for mark scheme).</p>

                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Implement a breakout game of your own design using
                            C or C++ and Xlib, meeting the gameplay requirements 
                            described above. As described above, you need to implement one 
                            additional feature of your choice.</li>
                        <li>You're encouraged to be creative in this assignment! Some 
                            portion of your grade is based on building an enjoyable and 
                            exciting game.</li>
                        <li>Your game must accept two command-line parameters:
                            <ol>
                                <li>"frame-rate", measured in frames per second, which controls 
                                    how often the screen is painted or redrawn</li>
                                <li>"speed", measured in pixels per second, which controls how 
                                fast the ball moves.</li>
                            </ol>
                            These two measures are independent of each other.  
                        </li>
                        <li>Your game should open with a splash screen that includes
                            your name, userid, and a description of how to play the
                            game (including a description of which keys to use).</li>
                        <li>Your game must use both the mouse and keyboard effectively. 
                            In-game actions should include the ability to move the paddle 
                            left and right, and quit the game.</li>
                        <li>Gameplay should progress as described above.</li>
                        <li>Your game must respond to window resize events.
                            The simplest (and perfectly adequate) strategy is to
                            scale the drawings to fit the window size.  You may
                            limit the size of the window so long as the minimum
                            size and maximum size are substantially different.</li>
                        <li>Your game will be single-threaded.</li>
                        <li>Your game will use double-buffering to eliminate any 
                            "stuttering" in gameplay.</li>
                        <li>Assume that the TA marking your game is a terrible
                            gamer.  You'll want to tune the game so that it provides an 
                            enjoyable experience for novice gamers. If your game includes 
                            levels or features that are not apparent from the beginning of
                            the game, you should include some sort of cheat function
                            to allow the TA to quickly access that feature.</li>
                        <li>Include a README file that discusses features the TA 
                            should be sure to look for.</li>
                        <li>Your event loop must:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Not consume all of the CPU cycles (test: Run the 
                                    "top" command in one terminal while running the 
                                    game in another.  Your game plus the X server
                                    should consume less than 25% of the CPU -- and 
                                    even 25% is high).</li>
                                <li>Repaint on a regular basis (~30 times/second) (test:
                                    Repaints at the same frequency no matter how many
                                    events are arriving)</li>
                                <li>Respond to events on a timely basis (test: Many 
                                    events coming all at once (e.g. resizing
                                    the window) should be handled without lag.)</li>
                                <li>Be easy to understand (tests: No nested loops,
                                    appropriate use of helper functions, etc.)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Submit a MakeFile such that the first target will compile
                            and execute your program.</li>
                    </ol>
                          
                <h2>Submission</h2>
                    <p>Check in to your personal SVN repository: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All files required to compile and run your program.</li>
                        <li>A <code>MakeFile</code> such that the first target compiles 
                            and executes your program.</li>
                        <li>A <code>README.txt</code> file to the marker.</li>
                        <li>Optional: <code>Feedback.txt</code> with your feedback on the assignment 
                            (i.e. feedback on the design of the assignment).</li>
                    </ul>

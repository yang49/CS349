-- Question: 2
-- The strategy behind the formulation of my answer:
-- 	First find the information about those advanced courses which was taught
--    by a CS prof and held in S03.
--    Then find the those prerequisite course in S03 which was taught by a non-CS prof
--    In the end use inner join use information on the cno
